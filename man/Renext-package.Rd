  Renewal Method for Extreme Values Extrapolation

}
\description{

  This package proposes fits and diagnostics for the so-called
  \emph{méthode du renouvellement}, an alternative to other "Peaks Over
  Threshold" (POT) methods.  The \emph{méthode du renouvellement}
  generalises the classical POT by allowing the excesses over the
  threshold to follow a probability distribution which can differ from
  the Generalised Pareto Distribution (GPD). Weibull or gamma
  excesses are sometimes preferred to GPD excesses. The special
  case of exponential excesses (which falls in the three families:
  GPD, Weibull and gamma) has a special interest since it allows exact
  inference for the (scalar) parameter and for the quantiles form OT
  data (only).
   
   The package allows the joint use of possibly three kinds of data or
   information. The first kind is \emph{classical excesses}, or
   \emph{"OT data"}. It can be completed with two kinds of data
   resulting from a temporal aggregation, as is often the case for
   \emph{historical data}. Both types are optional, and concern periods
   or \emph{blocks} that must not overlap nor cross the OT period.
   
   \itemize{
     
     \item \emph{MAX data} correspond to the case where one knows the
     \eqn{r}{r} largest observations over each block. The number
     \eqn{r}{r} may vary across blocks. This kind of data is often
     called '\eqn{r}{r}-largest', or "\eqn{r}{r}-Largest Order
     Statistics" (\eqn{r}{r}-LOS).
     
     \item \emph{OTS data} (for OT Supplementary data) correspond to the
     case where one knows for each block \eqn{b}{b} all the observations
     that exceeded a threshold \eqn{u_b}{u[b]} which is greater (usually
     much greater) than the main threshold \eqn{u}{u}. The number
     \eqn{r_b}{r[b]} of such observations can be zero, in which case we
     may say that \eqn{u_b}{u[b]} is an \emph{unobserved level}. A
     threshold \eqn{u_b}{u[b]} is sometimes called a \emph{perception
       threshold}.

   }

   Historical data are often available in hydrology (e.g. for river flood
   discharges, for sea-levels or sea surges) and can concern large
   periods such as past centuries. An unobserved level can typically be
   related to a material benchmark.
   
   Maximum likelihood estimation is made possible in this context of
   heterogeneous data. Inference is based on the asymptotic normality of
   parameter vector estimate and on linearisation ("delta method") for
   quantiles or parameter functions.

   The package allows the use of "marked-process observations" data
   (datetime of event and level) where an interevent analysis can be
   useful. It also allows the event dates to be unknown and replaced
   by a much broader \emph{block} indication, e.g. a year number. The
   key point is then that the "effective duration" (total duration of
   observation periods) is known. Event counts for blocks can be used to
   check the assumption of Poisson-distributed events.
   
   The package development was initiated, directed and financed by the
   french \emph{Institut de Radioprotection et de \enc{Sûreté}{Surete}
   \enc{Nucléaire}{Nucleaire}} (IRSN). The package is a non-academic
   tool designed for applied analysis on case studies and investigations
   or comparisons on classical probabilistic models.
