\title{Moment estimation for the mixture of two exponential distributions}
\description{
  Compute the moment estimation for the tree parameters of the mxture of
  two exponentials
}
\usage{
   mom.mixexp2(x)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{Sample. Vector containing values \code{>0}.}
}
\details{
  The three parameters (probability and the two rates) are computed from
  the first three moments (theroretical and sample). It can be shown
  that the inverse rates are obtained solving a quadratic
  equation. However the roots can be negative or complex and the
  estimates are not valid ones.
}
\value{
  A list with elements
  \item{estimate}{
    A vector with named elements \code{"prob1"}, \code{"rate1"}
    and \code{"rate2"}. When the moment estimators are not valid
    (negative or complex rates), a vector of three \code{NA} is
    returned.}

\note{
The theroretical coefficient of variation (CV) of a mixture of two
exponentials always exceed 100\%. When the sample CV is over 100\%, no
valid estimates exist since the two first moments can not be matched.
