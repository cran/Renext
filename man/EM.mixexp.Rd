\description{
  Experimental function for Expectation-Maximisation (EM)

}
\usage{
   EM.mixexp(x, m = 2)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{Sample vector with values \code{>0}. }
  \item{m}{Number of mixture components}
  %%\item{plot}{If \code{TRUE} the expectation parameters (inverse
  %%rates) are 'matplot'-ted as functions of iteration number.}
}
\details{
   The EM algorithm is very simple for exponential mixtures (as well as
   for many other mixture models).

   According to a general feature of EM, this iterative method leads to
   successive estimates with increasing likelihood but which may
   converge to a local maximum of the likelihood.

\note{
  The estimation is done for expectation (inverse rates) but
  the \code{estimate} vector in the result contains rates for
  compatibility reasons (e.g with exponential).
