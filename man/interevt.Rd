\title{Interevents (or interarrivals) from events dates}
\description{
  Compute intervent durations from events dates
}
\usage{
   interevt(date,
            skip = NULL, noskip = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{date}{A POSIXct vector containing the date(time) of the events.}
  \item{skip}{A data.frame containing two POSIXct columns \code{start} and
    \code{end} describing the periods to skip over. }
  \item{noskip}{A data.frame like \code{skip} but where the periods
    define the NON skipped part of the events.}
}
\details{
   Interevents are the time differences between successive
   dates. When the \code{date} argument contains occurrence times
   \eqn{T_i}{T[i]} for successive events of an homogeneous Poisson
   process, interevents \eqn{T_i -T_{i-1}}{T[i]-T[i-1]} are mutually
   independent with the same exponential distribution.

   When some time intervals are skipped independently from the event
   point process, we may consider the interevents
   \eqn{T_i-T_{i-1}}{T[i]-T[i-1]} between two non-skipped events
   such that the time interval
   \eqn{(T_{i-1},\,T_i)}{(T[i-1], T[i])} does not contains any
   skipped interval. 
   These interevents still are mutually independent
   with the same exponential distribution. 
   When \code{skip} or \code{noskip} is not \code{NULL} the computation therefore only retains
   couples of two successive datetimes
   "falling" in the same non-skipped period, which number can therefore be 
   associated with the interevent.    
}
\value{
  A list mainly containing a \code{interevt} data.frame.
  \item{interevt}{Data.frame. Each row describes a retained interevent
    through a \code{period} integer giving
    the "noskip" period, a \code{start} and \code{end} POSIX and a
    \code{duration} in \bold{days}.
  }
  \item{noskip}{Only hen \code{skip} or \code{noskip} args have been
    given. A data.frame containing broadly the same information as the
    \code{noskip} arg is it was given or the information deduced from
    the \code{skip} arg if given.
  }
  \item{axis}{When needed, a list with some material to build an axis with uneven
    ticks as in the \code{gof.date} with \code{skip.action = "omit"}.

\note{
  Only one of the two arguments \code{skip} and \code{noskip} should be
  given in the call. In each case, the rows of the returned
  data.frame objects
  describe periods in chronological order. That is: \code{start} at row \code{2}
  must be after the \code{end} value of row \code{1} and so on.

  Note that there are usually less interevents than dates since two
  successive dates will be retained for an interevent only when they are
  not separated by missing period. As a limit case, there can be no
  interevents if  the \code{noskip} periods contain only one date from
  the \code{date} vector.

\examples{
## Use Brest data
ie <- interevt(date = Brest$OTdata$date, skip = Brest$OTmissing)

expplot(ie$interevt$duration, rate = 1 / mean(ie$interevt$duration),
  main = "No threshold")

## keep only data over a threshold
ind1 <- Brest$OTdata$Surge >= 35
ie1 <- interevt(Brest$OTdata$date[ind1], skip = Brest$OTmissing)
expplot(ie1$interevt$duration, main = "Threshold = 35")

## increase threshold
ind2 <- Brest$OTdata$Surge >= 55
ie2 <- interevt(date = Brest$OTdata$date[ind2], skip = Brest$OTmissing)
expplot(ie2$interevt$duration, main = "Threshold = 55 cm")
