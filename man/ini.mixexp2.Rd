\title{Simple  estimation for the mixture of two exponential distributions}
\description{
  Compute a simple (preliminary) estimation for the tree parameters of
  the mixture of two exponential distributions
}
\usage{
   ini.mixexp2(x, plot = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{Sample: numerical vector with elements \code{>0}.}
%%  \item{pct}{Pair of percents for the estimation. The upper percent
%%    indicates the largest data to estimate \code{prob1} and \code{rate1}
%%    by linear regression. The lower indicates the smallest data to
%%    estimate \code{rate2} using a regression line trhough the origin.}
  \item{plot}{Should a graphic be displayed?}
}
\details{
  This function gives estimators using several methods if
  necessary. The goal is to find the rates \code{rate1},
  \code{rate2} and the mixing probability \code{prob1} with the
  'feasibility' constraints \code{0 < rate1 < rate2} and
  \code{0 < prob1 < 1}. 

  First the method of moments is used. If the estimates are
  feasible they are returned with \code{method = "moments"}.
  If not, the estimates are derived
  using two linear regressions. A
  regression without constant using only the smallest values
  gives an estimator of the mean rate.
  A regression using only the largest values
  gives \code{rate1} and \code{prob1}. Yet  the constraints
  must be fulfilled. If they are, the estimates are returned
  (together with  \code{method = "Hreg"} suggesting a 
  cumulative hazard regression). If not, a (poor) default estimate
  is returned with  \code{method = "arbitrary"}.
}
\value{
  A list 
  \item{estimate}{A vector with named elements \code{"prob1"}, \code{"rate1"}
    and \code{"rate2"}. }
  \item{method}{The method that really produced the estimators.}

\note{  
  The method of moments is implemented in \code{mom.mixexp2}.
  Further investigations are needed to compare the estimators
  (moments or Hreg) and select the best strategy.

  Note that this function returns the estimate within a list 
  and no longer as a vector with named elements as was the
  case before.
