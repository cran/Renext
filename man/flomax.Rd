  ML estimation of the Lomax distribution

}
\description{
  
  Fast Maximum Likelihood estimation of the Lomax distribution.

}
\usage{
flomax(x,
       info.observed = FALSE,
       plot = FALSE,
       scaleData = TRUE,
       cov = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{

    Sample vector to be fitted. Should contain only positive
    non-NA values.

  }
  \item{info.observed}{

    Should the observed information matrix be used or the expected one
    be used?

  }
  \item{plot}{

    Logical. If \code{TRUE}, a plot will be produced showing the
    derivative of the concentrated log-likelihood, function of the shape
    parameter.

  }
  \item{scaleData}{

    Logical. If \code{TRUE} observations in \code{x}
    (which are positive) are divided by their mean value.
    The results are in theory not affected by this transformation, but
    scaling the data could improve the estimation in some cases. 
    The log-likelihood plots are shown using the scaled values so
    the returned estimate of the scale parameter is not the
    the abscissa of the maximum shown on the plot.

  }
  \item{cov}{
    
     Logical. If \code{FALSE}, a minimal estimation is performed with
     no covariance matrix or derivative returned. This can be useful
     when a large number of ML estimations are required, e.g. to sample
     from a likelihood ratio.

   }
}
\details{

  The likelihood is concentrated with respect to the shape parameter.
  This function is increasing for small values of the scale parameter
  \eqn{\beta}. For large \eqn{\beta}, the derivative of the concentrated
  log-likelihood tends to zero, and its sign is that of \eqn{(1 -
  \textrm{CV}^2)}{(1-CV^2)} where \eqn{\textrm{CV}}{CV} is the
  coefficient of variation, computed using \eqn{n} as denominator in the
  formula for the standard deviation.
  
  The ML estimate does not exist when the sample has a coefficient of
  variation CV less than 1 and it may fail to be found when CV is
  greater than yet close to 1.
  
}
\value{
   A list with the following elements
   \item{estimate}{

     Parameter ML estimates.

   }
   \item{sd}{

     Vector of (asymptotic) standard deviations for the estimates.

   }
   \item{loglik}{

     The maximised log likelihood.

   }
   \item{dloglik}{

     Gradient of the log-likelihood at the optimum. Its two
     elements should normally be close to zero.

   }
   \item{cov}{

     The (asymptotic) covariance matrix computed from theoretical or
     observed information matrix.

   }
   \item{info}{

     The information matrix.

\note{

  The estimates are biased for small or medium sized sample. The bias is
  positive for the shape parameter, thus the estimated shape tends to be
  larger than the true unknown value.

  Fitting a Lomax distribution to an exponential sample might lead to a
  divergence since the exponential is the limit of a Lomax distribution
  with large shape and large scale with constant ratio shape/scale.
  Fitting this distribution to a sample having a coefficient of
  variation smaller than 1 is not allowed since it should lead to
  divergence of the estimation.
