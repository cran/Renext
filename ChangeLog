     	CHANGES IN Renext package VERSION 2.0-0

CHANGES

    o This 'Changelog' cleaned.	


	CHANGES IN Renext package VERSION 1.5-1

CHANGES

    o Typos in the 'RenextGuide' document.

 
		CHANGES IN Renext package VERSION 1.5-0

CHANGES

    o The 'fit.Renouv' function is renamed 'Renouv' as would 
    expect most R users.

    o The shifted Pareto 'spareto' distribution and its functions
    are renamed as "Lomax" distribution and 'xlomax' with x in 
    "d", "p", "r", "h", "H". 

    o Many slight changes in the vignette most of them striving
    to improve the English.

    o The vignette code (.Rnw) and subsequent material needed
    is no longer shipped with the package for the sake of its
    size and the resources needed in the build step.
    
    o The warning message produced when hessian is not definite
    negative is strengthened.


BUG FIXES

    o In the 'plot.Renouv' function, when historical data 
    are shown on the plot it can be the case that their
    number exceeds the predicted number. This was a problem
    for the determination of the plotting position. Now the 
    predicted number is modified in order to be at least the 
    observed number.


		CHANGES IN Renext package VERSION 1.4-1

CHANGES

    o The 'fRenouv' function is REMOVED, and 'fit.Renouv' should
    now be used.    

    o Many minor corrections (essentially spelling) were made
    in the documentation.	

    o The documentation of the 'fit.Renouv' function now lists
    the 'special distributions' and their parameters.

    o  The 'print.summary.Renouv' function now informs the user
    about the inference method used (delta method or exact chi 
    square). It also displays relevant information about historical 
    blocks used in the fit, if any.
  
    o The 'ret.lev' table returned by 'fit.Renouv' no longer
    has rownames indicating the return period. The reason is 
    that this table (a data.frame object) can not by default
    have ties in its rownames, and formating general (not
    'pretty') return periods is difficult. 

    o Changes in the vignette.  NOT FULLY CHECKED YET (spelling!)
    Some details have been added about the "log-exponential" and the 
    "square-exponential" distributions.


BUG FIXES

    o The 'predict.Renouv' gave an error when the object 'x'
    had a transformation 'trans.y'. Fixed. 

    o The 'fit.Renouv' function returned in some cases 
    an error message in place of a table in its 'ret.lev' element. 
    This was due to 'rownames'. Fixed.



		CHANGES IN Renext package VERSION 1.4-0

CHANGES

    o  The 'plot.Renouv' function was changed. The 'problim'
    and 'Tlim' arg now work as expected. The rule to set the x axis
    is quite complex to describe, but yet rather natural to use. 

    o The vignette was modified mainly in the chapter devoted to 
    the 'fit.Renouv'. The two types of historical data 'MAX' and 
    'OTS' are now described with their likelihood. There is no 
    longer reference to the old 'fRenouv' function, and all 
    code chunks now refer to 'fit.Renouv'. The methods for 
    'Rendata' and 'Renouv' classes are shortly described.


BUG FIXES

    o  In 'fit.Renouv', a problem occurred when only one MAX block
    was given without being enclosed in a list().

    o In 'plot.Renouv' it was implicitly assumed that 'L.95'
    and 'U.95' were present in the table which caused an error
    in the determination of the y axis.


		CHANGES IN Renext package VERSION 1.3-1

NEW FEATURES 		
			
    o  'fit.Renouv' now internally uses the function 'plot.Renouv'
    when its 'plot' formal is set to TRUE

    		   
CHANGES 

    o Packages 'evd', 'numDeriv' are now required 'Depends'.


BUG FIXES

    o  In 'fit.Renouv', a bug affected 'historical data' arguments. It
    caused problems with "gpd" distribution with historical data.   


		CHANGES IN Renext package VERSION 1.3-0

NEW FEATURES 		
			
    o  'fit.Renouv' now internally uses the function 'plot.Renouv'
    when its 'plot' formal is set to TRUE

    		   
CHANGES 

    o Packages 'evd', 'numDeriv' are now required 'Depends'.

    o In 'makeOTSdata' and 'makeOTSdata' giving a NULL value to the
    argument data allows to bypass the use of the historical data
    possibly present in the x object. A similar behaviour is know retained
    in the the 'fit.Renouv' function.

    o In 'plot.Renouv', the arguments have been changed. 'pct.conf', and
    arguments concerning marks suffixed as '.mark'. By default, no
    mark is shown. The arguments 'main' and 'ylim' have been removed but 
    can still be used through the dots mechanism. The new arguments 'problim'
    and 'Tlim' allow the user to set the axis limits. When historical data	
    are present in the object, they are now plotted with filled symbols, the
    filling color indicates the block.

	
BUG FIXES

    o  In 'fit.Renouv' a problem occurred with MAX data when 
    one block was given as a numeric vector (rather than a list).
    A numeric problem occurred in with 'OTS' data with no threshold
    exceedances due to the use of r*log(1-F) with r = 0 and F very
    close to 1.  
    


		CHANGES IN Renext package VERSION 1.2-0

NEW FEATURES 		
			
    o New function 'fit.Renouv'. This is mainly a cleaned version of
    'fRenouv' (which will remains here for a couple of  sub-versions).  
    The historical data are now clearly identified as of two types 'MAX'
    and 'OTS',	both using one or several periods called blocks. MAX 
    data (or r-max) are as before with new formals; OTS data use blocks 
    with all values over a known threshold over the main sample threshold. 
    The likelihood is then slightly different than that of the MAX-data case.
    		   
    o New S3 class 'Renouv' with methods: 'summary', 'coefficients', 'predict'  
    and 'plot'. The method 'predict' computes return levels and confidence
    bounds (when possible), while 'plot' produces a return level plot 
    with the main sample and also historical data when present. 
    
    o New method for the class 'Rendata': 'summary'. The 'plot'
    method was slightly changed to show historical data when this is
    possible.	

    o New function 'OTjitter'. Works like 'jitter' but avoids  
    jiterrized data falling under the threshold. This is used
    in 'fit.Renouv' to avoid the warning concerning ties in 
    the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In practice, there seem to very very
    little difference in the stat and p-value when jitterizing is
    used.


CHANGES 

    o Vignette. Correction of an error (p. 32) about the return-level.
    Modification of the parts concerning historical data.


		CHANGES IN Renext package VERSION 1.1-0

CHANGES 		
			
    o Function 'qmixexp2': quadratic interpolation during the first
    iterations replaced by a simpler linear interpolation, i.e. a
    standard Newton-Raphson method, easier to analyze. The method
    has been secured by placing the iterate below the true unknown root
    on the basis of concavity, by inflating the derivative if needed. 
    Scale the data through a multiplication of these by the smallest
    rate names 'rate1', which should improve numerical accuracy.
    
    o Vignette. Correction of bugs in the index and around code 
    chunks. The were due to end of lines chars that were moved
    in the .Rnw source file.

    o Vignette. Correction of several misspells or typos. Added a figure  
    showing GPD densities for several values of the shape parameter 'xi'.
